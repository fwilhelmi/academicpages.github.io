Short Bio
======
Francesc holds a B.Sc. degree in Telematics Engineering (2015) and an M.Sc. in Intelligent and Interactive Systems (2016), both from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies at UPF. His Ph.D. thesis is mostly focused on spectral efficiency for high-density wireless networks, with emphasis on multi-agent systems for decentralized and distributed scenarios. Francesc is also involved in standardization activities within the ITU-T. In particular, his an active collaborator of the Focus Group on Machine Learning for Future Networks including 5G (FG-ML5G), where he has acted as an editor, a mentor on students projects, and organized a problem statement for the ITU-T AI Challenge. With regards to education, Francesc has been a teaching assistant in the “Networks”, “Wireless Multimedia Networks” and “Laboratory Networks” subjects at the UPF from 2015 to present.
