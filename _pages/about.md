Francesc holds a BSc degree in Telematics Engineering from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (2015) with a focus on Broadband and Wireless Communications. With the aim of applying new techniques for solving many well-known problems in communications, Francesc obtained his MSc degree in Intelligent and Interactive Systems also from the UPF in 2016. He is now a Ph.D. Student in the Wireless Networking Group (WN) of the Department of Information and Communication Technologies (DTIC) at the UPF. His Ph.D. thesis is mostly focused on spectral efficiency for high-density wireless networks, thus showing the potential of applying techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) in decentralized scenarios.

Francesc is also involved in some standardization activities held by the ITU-T. In particular, his an active collaborator of the Focus Group on Machine Learning for Future Networks including 5G (FG-ML5G).

With regards to education, Francesc has been a teaching assistant in the “Networks”, “Wireless Multimedia Networks” and “Laboratory Networks” subjects at the UPF from 2015 to present.
