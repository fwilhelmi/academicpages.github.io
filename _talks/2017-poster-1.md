**Abstract:** Popularity of IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) leads to massive deployments in which few frequency resources must be shared, resulting in inefficiency in dense environments. The behavior of the protocols that grant access to the medium, which are based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), is inefficient in dense deployments, and prone to generate issues such as the Hidden-Terminal and the Exposed-Terminal problems. Therefore, the overall throughput may be considerably reduced due to collisions and/or starvation. As the complexity of Wireless Networks in terms of variability prevents to computationally find the optimal configuration for a given network, we aim to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to find close-to-optimal solutions adaptively.

**Abstract:** 
Understanding the consequences of applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) in dense and uncoordinated environments (e.g., Wi-Fi) is critical to optimize the performance of next-generation wireless networks. In this document we present a decentralized approach in which Wireless Networks (WNs) attempt to learn the best possible configuration in an adversarial environment according to their own performance. In particular, we provide a Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) based model in which devices are allowed to tune their frequency channel, transmit power and Carrier Sense Threshold (CST). Our results show that, despite using only local information, a collaborative behavior can be obtained among independent devices that share the same resources. Furthermore, we study the effects of applying such method under different equilibrium situations with respect to the adversarial setting. Finally, some insights are provided regarding the consequences of applying learning in presence of legacy nodes.
