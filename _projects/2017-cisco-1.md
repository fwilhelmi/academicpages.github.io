This project aims to study the IEEE 802.11ax amendment in detail to allow the inclusion of novel techniques that enhance the networks performance. For that purpose, an IEEE 802.11ax simulation tool is being developed. The whole project regarding the 11ax Simulator can be found in [https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor](https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor). In addition, a brief tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/raw/master/Documentation/Technical%20Report/LaTeX%20files/komondor_technical_report.pdf).
